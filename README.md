This is my project of building a basic MEAN stack app. It's a coffee roast logger.

It's running [here](http://radiant-fortress-9346.herokuapp.com/#/) if you want to check it out. Please give it a moment to spin up the free dyno ;)

It's set to use non-local hosting so if you wre to download it you'd have to make those changes accordingly. Other than that you could run it locally with

    npm install
    bower install
    grunt
