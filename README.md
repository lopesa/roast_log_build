This is a very rough work in progress of my building a basic MEAN stack app. This is a roaster log app, but really I'm just getting used to the core functionality of all the parts of the stack.

If anyone find themselves here and looking at how ridiculously I've attempted to execute something, I'd love for you to leave me a message about it. This whole project is for me to learn.
